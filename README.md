This repo includes projects completed as elements of my portfolio. See findings and summary walkthroughs for them them displayed on my [website here](https://austinbrian.github.io/blog/portfolio/).

The code for the following projects is found in their respective folders here.

* **tax_votes** - This project combines data from the US IRS, and examines how tax filings, aggregated at the county level, predict the relationship with propensity to vote for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. The most impactful variables in a random forest analysis of this relationship was the number of people with student loan debt in a county.
